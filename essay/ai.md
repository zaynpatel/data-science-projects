posting on github because I'm sure someone else will publish a similar essay before I get a chance to finish.

# The winners of AI [storyboard]

************Introduction************

In a private essay, written in early January, I wrote: “The number of times users are pleasantly surprised is a reliable heuristic to measure a products likelihood to acquire loyal customers. It’s especially good when these users are so surprised with their experience they spend time writing about it online.” The app that inspired this quote was ChatGPT and now, with the recent release of GPT-4, this product too.

*************************************************************************************OSI Stack explainer*************************************************************************************

— *************************************************************************************what did it mean for networking and early Internet (break down the parts and give examples of companies and examples of how someone would use it) who created the model, why did they create the model.************************************************************************************* 

— *************************************************************************************why was it helpful and can we see a chart (c+p current OSI stack and share distribution of companies & top companies from each) of how the value distribution occurred?*************************************************************************************

*********************************************AI Stack explainer********************************************* 

— *********************************************how did I generate this (break down the parts, companies, examples of how people are using it)*********************************************

[Physical]: CPUs, GPUs, TPUs, FPGAs, ASICs, hardware accelerators

***********What is it?***********

- CPU: This is the current processor **********************(what is a processor)********************** found in a computer that runs general-purpose tasks like operating system management, basic computations *****************************(what are these computations)*****************************, and software applications **************************************(what are these software applications)**************************************. They are not optimized for large-scale, parallel processing *****(why?)***** required for deep learning and other AI applications.
    - processor: **registers** (small and fast memory locations used to hold data for processing), **cache** (to store frequently accessed data), **************************control unit************************** (manages execution instructions), ********ALU******** (math). **********************processors are a type of chip designed to perform specific functions and are the most important component in a computer system.**********************
    - CPU physics and design: they are built to process tasks sequentially (in the order they come in) and are good for single threading. they have a small number of processing cores (what is a core) which limits the amount of parallel processing they can perform.

***********************************How have these evolved/what are they being used for now and why are these hardware parts useful for each other?***********************************

— *********************************************why, pulling from analytical learnings in OSI stack, does this represent the next platform well and how value is going to accrue*********************************************

— *********************************************why do I think this is different from Internet where the value isn’t as evenly distributed and instead goes to the lower companies even more*********************************************

— *********************************************what application layer projects are worth building (how many cents on the dollar will they give to OpenAI)*********************************************

— *********************************************why are datasets more important than company and what is the criteria of a dataset that’s worth acquiring (think on company side now)*********************************************

*********************************************What am I excited about (KaaS, [discover you’re excited about in computing - could we have new operating systems or databases for AI stack], )*********************************************
